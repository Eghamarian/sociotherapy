I have been suffering from anxiety and depression all my life. To give you some perspective, I am now 40 years old and I have been under the influence of these problems for the past 20 years. And this is not because I refused to seek professional help. In fact, I have been under the care of psychologists and psychiatrists most of my life. Some of them diagnosed me with OCD and gave me anti-depressants and others believed I had bipolar disorder and gave me relevant medications. However, none of these treatment paths proved efficacious. What the medications did for me was to make me stop feeling instead of helping me feel better. Throughout the years I also tried various branches of psychotherapy including person-centered and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The outcome was never satisfactory. But I never gave up looking for solutions. Parallel to seeking help, I embarked on a journey of finding answers to my problem on my own. This is why I obtained an undergraduate degree in psychology, a graduate degree in economics and have been reading sociological explanations of mental health problems on my own. After all these years, I believe I have managed to put together some form of explanation for why I am depressed and anxious, and why mainstream treatments are not effective in treating my problems. I am making this website to share my story, because I think it is important for everyone to know about alternative perspectives, and to know where the problem really lies.
