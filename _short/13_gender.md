- Honey!
- Yeah?
- We need to change our car.
- And get what instead?
- A Tesla?
- Why?
- It has less environmental impact.
- We have a private jet!
- That's ok. Half of them have one too.
- Who?
- A group of celebrities I've been hanging out with. 
- What does that have anything to do with our car?
- They are extremely environmentally conscious and I really want to fit in. 
- Who are these celebrities?
- I can't tell you. You can't keep a secret.
- They are celebrities; you are probably all over their instagram. 
- That's different.
- You are not making sense at all. 
- Please????
- Ugh. Alright; but just because you are the man I love, doesn't mean you can get away with it every time. 
- Promise. Promise. Just this once. 
- Ok. 
- Love you.
- Love you too.
