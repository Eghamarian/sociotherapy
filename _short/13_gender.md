- Honey!<br>
- Yeah?<br>
- We need to change our car.<br>
- And get what instead?<br>
- A Tesla?<br>
- Why?<br>
- It has less environmental impact.<br>
- We have a private jet!<br>
- That's ok. Half of them have one too.<br>
- Who?<br>
- A group of celebrities I've been hanging out with.<br> 
- What does that have anything to do with our car?<br>
- They are extremely environmentally conscious, and I really want to fit in.<br> 
- Who are these celebrities?<br>
- I can't tell you; you can't keep a secret.<br>
- They are celebrities; you are probably all over the internet as we speak.<br> 
- That's different.<br>
- You are making no sense at all.<br> 
- Please????<br>
- Ugh. Alright; but just because I love, doesn't mean you can get away with it every time.<br> 
- Promise. Promise. Just this once. <br>
- Ok. <br>
- You are the most wonderful wife ever. I Love you.<br>
- Love you too. <br>
