Were we always this vile, or was I blind?<br>
If it was me, why the endless accolades for humanness of humans?<br>

Are we calling a bad dog, a good dog, so it does the right thing under pressure?<br>
If so, we are certainly failing, because we are the lowliest creatures walking the earth.<br>

Forget about the media downplaying scandals, corruption, cheating, raping and theft of important people. <br>
Forget about the media magnifying a man who rescued a kuala from the middle of the road. <br>
Look around you. Most of us take what we can. Most of us do it, when no one is looking. <br>
Most of us do it, even if it's not our turn; most of us do it, even if it's not right.<br><br>

We pretend we like each other, but we don't. We don't like each other and we lie about it.<br>
We think not saying "nigger", solves racism against black people; <br>
and using "her" instead of "his" to refer to countries, solves sexism. <br>
  
But there is only one rule we truly follow: "take what you can cuz if you don't, someone else will". <br>
We all have that stored in our hearts and minds; thanks to neo-liberalism. <br>
We are alone, and inhuman.  <br><br>
  
What makes us look remotely like real humans, is the law. <br>
But we always bend the law, especially if we are from countries with flexible law.<br>
Notorious among these are Iranians. <br> 
When you talk to us, we picture Iran as the oldest civilization on face of the Earth. <br>
We introduce ourselves as warm, cultured and human. <br>
But we are invariably ahead of everyone in cheating to get what we want. <br>
Make no mistake; you are all the same, if the law looses color. <br>
In fact this is why important people in developed countries do it; <br>
they do it becuase they think they can get away with it using their influence, and they do.<br>
