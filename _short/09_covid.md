Were we always this vile, or was I blind?
If it was me, why the endless accolades for humanness of humans?

Are we calling a bad dog, a good dog, so it does the right thing under pressure?
If so, we are certainly failing, because we are the lowliest creatures walking the earth.

Forget about the media downplaying the scandals, corruption, cheating, raping and theft of important people, and
magnifying a man who rescuing a kuala from the middle of the road.
Look around you. most of us take what we can. Most of us do it if no one is looking. 
Most of us do it, even if it's not our turn; Most of us do it, even if it's not right.

We pretend we like each other. But we don't; We don't like each other and we lie about it.
There is only one rule we follow; "take what you can cuz if you don't, someone else will". 
We all have that stored in our hearts and minds; thanks to neo-liberalism. 
We are alone and inhuman.
