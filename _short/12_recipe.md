<div align="center">

A cup full of arrogance,<br>
half a cup of ignorance,<br>
two dozen cups of confidence,<br>
a generous amount of obsession, <br>
and a gallon of indifference.<br><br>
  
Stir fry indifference until it changes color from indifferent to impartial.<br>
Bring confidence to a boil and add ignorance and confidence to it,<br>
Stir until they dissolve into a competitive sporit,<br>
Strain the mix and empty the content in a pyrex,<br>
Cut arrogance in the shape of leadership and lay them around the container,<br>
Leave the whole thing before politicians' eyes for some time.<br>
<br>
Voil√†, market economy is ready to serve.<br>
