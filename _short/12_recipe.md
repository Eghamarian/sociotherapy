<div align="center">

A cup full of arrogance,<br>
half a cup of ignorance,<br>
two dozen cups of confidence,<br>
a generous amount of obsession, <br>
and a gallon of indifference,<br><br>
  
Stir fry indifference until it changes color from indifferent to impartial.<br>
Bring confidence to a boil,<br>
Stir and add ignorance and obsession to the mix until it dissolves into competitive spirit,<br>
Strain the mix and empty the content in a pyrex,<br>
Take conscience out of arrogance, cut it in shape of leadership and lay it around the container,<br>
This is optional, but to make the dish an easy choice, and to mask the remnant smell of raw conscience,<br>  
add a hint of anti-commusim before leaving the dish in politicians' sight for a short time.<br>
<br>
  Voil√†, <em>Market Economy</em> is ready to serve.<br>
