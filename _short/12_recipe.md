<div align="center">

A cup full of arrogance,<br>
half a cup of ignorance,<br>
two dozen cups of confidence,<br>
a generous amount of obsession, <br>
a gallon of indifference,<br>
and a ton of avarice. <br><br>
  
Stir fry indifference until it changes color to equal opportunity,<br>
Bring confidence to a boil, and add ignorance and obsession to it,<br>
Stir until they dissolve, and the mix thickens into competitive spirit,<br>
Lay a layer of greed in a pyrex and leave it in oven until it puffs into ambition,<br>
When cooked, pour the spirit over ambition, add equal opportunity on top, and leave it to cool down,<br>
Then take conscience out of arrogance, cut it in shape of leadership and lay it around the container,<br>
This is optional, but to make the dish an easy choice, and to mask the remnant smell of raw conscience,<br>  
add a hint of anti-commusim before leaving the dish in politicians' sight for a short time.<br>
<br>
Voil√†, <em>Market Economy</em> is ready to serve.<br>
