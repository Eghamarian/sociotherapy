We can hardly look after ourselves, let alone our loved ones. <br>
But we are surrounded by digital advertising machines showcasing a few success stories, who made it to the top; 
the traditionally successful and so-called influencers. <br>
But their secret is easy to find, because sharing it has been a recent trend, and they do anything for a few more likes. <br>  
The key word is <em> passive </em>; passive income, passive attention, passive weight loss, passive everything. <br>
Loose weight while eating; learn a language in sleep, earn a decent salary without working. <br>
You may think I want to complain about the old, but yet important and valid, idea that people want to take waiting out of wanting. <br>
But you would be wrong.   <br>
My concern is that passiveness has contaminated more important parts of our lives. <br>
We now have <b> passive activism </b>, which is when we do our share of activism by clicking a link, 
liking a post, or leaving a post before closing our laptop and going to bed.<br>
We hope while we sleep, our post frees Julian Assange, our like saves the Earth, and our shared link illuminates.<br>
But while we sleep, nothing happens. <br>
Nothing happens except our links and likes and posts enter the magnetic field of social media and become polarized into shot into distant poles, 
liked by other passive activists. <br>
And the number of likes never beat the cute cat, the sexy 18-year-old ass, and the dance videos. <br>
So, basically, our links and likes and posts are shot into the distance while we sleep, just like a dream; <br>
As if it was never real, and will never be.<br>
