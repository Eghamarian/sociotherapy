<div align="left">


Begging for companionship,<br>
I paid for touch,<br>
She arrived as an angel,<br>
Looked for notes sitting on a side table,<br>
She found them and turned on the character,<br>
She started aggressive, which shows many are need in need of trusted direction,<br>
I invited her to calm down,<br>
She looked puzzled but calmed down, and crawled into the bed, <br>
Disgusted but consumed with consumerism,<br>
Bewildered by instagram trends and what she could buy with my semen,<br>
I took off my clothes; hesitantly,<br>
I crawled next to her and she overcame her inhibitions; seemingly successfully,<br>
But what do I know; I am blind for being a man, <br>  
I shut down and diverted my brain two floors down,<br>
She let me, and encouraged me to end it soon; seductively,<br>
I wanted to please her, but shutters were shut; naturally.<br>
I licked her, cherished her, caressed her, worshiped her, but the window to the garden was foggy, the lock was rusty, and the frame was safeguarding the flood of 
emotions coming through, <br>
Understandably, <br>
I arrived and she could wrap up, <br>
She thought about the next stop; discretely, <br>
She checked her phone to judge who was worth responding to, <br>
She quickly responded to a few, <br>
I was empty as a man, but full of desire to remain, <br>
She danced her way out though, <br>
I sat down hollow, looking at the wall blocking my view, <br>
And I had no idea what she looked at next, <br>
And never will.<br>
