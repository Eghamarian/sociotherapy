<div align="center">
Looking from high above, the current is towards decay.<br>
Coming a little closer, the norm is to surrender. <br>
Zooming yet a little further, organisms are visible, <br>
with their tongues out, and their hands flapping next to their ears.<br>
Coming closer so we can hear, they laugh in face of their fears. <br>
They know they will die, but continue to bear life. <br>  
They know they will loose, but refuse to let decay get its way.<br> 
And I'm thinking, blessed are those, who are close enough to hear; <br>
and doomed, those who are far away, and only witness the fray.<br>
