<div align="center">
Looking from above, the current is towards decay.<br>
Coming a little closer, the norm is to surrender to decay. <br>
Zooming yet a little more, organisms are visible with their tongues out and their hands flapping next to their ears.<br>
Coming close enough to hear them, the message is that the little ones following them are their children. <br>
That is the only way they can fight decay.<br>
And blessed are those who are close enough to hear the message rather than far away to only see decay.<br>
