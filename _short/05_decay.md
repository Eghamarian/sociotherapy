<div align="center">
Looking from high above, the current is towards decay.<br>
Coming a little closer, the norm is to surrender to decay. <br>
Zooming yet a little more, organisms are visible, with their tongues out, and their hands flapping next to their ears.<br>
Coming close enough so we can hear, the message is that the little ones following them are their heirs. <br>
That is the only way they can fight decay.<br>
And blessed are those, who are close enough to hear, rather than far away to only see the decay.<br>
