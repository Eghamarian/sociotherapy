<div align="center">

I've been almost dying, but not dying for too long now.<br>
I've been wishing myself dead, but not trying for as long now.<br>
For too long have I waited for a push, or a blow. <br>
Never did I dare to, and I'm living on a rope now.<br>
It's been too long, I can't bore you with it now.<br>
Should've ended moaning, should've done it long ago.<br>
It is now another goal, that I failed to follow.<br>
It is just another hope, that I shared till hollowed.<br>
I should stop.<br>
Wishing or sharing; I should stop.
