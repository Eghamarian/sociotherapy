<div align="center">

I've been almost dying, but not dying for too long now.<br>
I've been wishing myself dead, but not trying for as long now.<br>
For too long have I waited for a push, or a blow. <br>
No one ever dared to, and I'm still on the rope; wishing for a gentle blow.<br>
It's been too long I can't bore you with it now.<br>
Should've stopped nagging, should've done it long time ago.<br>
It is just another goal that I failed to follow.<br>
It is just another hope that I shared till hollowed.<br>
I should stop.<br>
Wishing, sharing; I should stop.
