<div align="center">

I've been almost dying, but not dying for too long now.
I've been wishing myself dead, but not trying for as long now.
For too long have I waited for a push, or a blow. 
No one ever dared to, and I'm still on the rope now; wishing for a gentle blow.
It's been too long I can't bore you with it now.
Should've stopped nagging, should've done it a long time ago.
It is just another goal that I failed to follow.
It is just another hope that I shared till hollowed.
