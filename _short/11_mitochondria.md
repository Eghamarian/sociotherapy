<div align="center">

Get mad, get brutally lonely and remember; <br>
remember we have no way of finding out. <br>
So believe in lies or surrender. <br>
Whatever you do, know that nature only and indifferently remembers persistence. <br>
She can forgive you as a murderer, or kill you as a toddler. <br>
Cruel it seems. <br>
But this way, mistakes will be washed away, until they recur. <br>
And mutations bear out of pain, despair or desire. <br>
So keep at it and it will be a flaw, or keep falling until you fly.
