<div align="center">

Get mad if you want; or get brutally lonely, but remember; <br>
remember we have no way of finding out. <br>
So believe in lies or surrender. <br>
Whatever you do, know that nature, only and indifferently, remembers persistence. <br>
She can forget a murderer, or kill a toddler. <br>
Cruel it seems. <br>
But this way, mistakes will be washed away, unless they recur. <br>
And mutations bear out of pain, desire or despair. <br>
So keep at it and it will be a flaw, or keep falling until you fly. <br>
What to repeat, is ours to figure.
<br>
