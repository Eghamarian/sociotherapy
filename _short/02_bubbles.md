<div align="center">
When under water, your screams transform into trapped air. <br>
When under water for long, you will learn, no longer to bother. <br>
When under water all your life, you become translucent; <br>
like water; <br>
You become a dreamer of voices and air; <br> 
And you scream in all your nightmares <br>

And when you are repeatedly hurt by those who donâ€™t hear you, <br> 
you think of dissolving forever. <br>
For in their ears, your absence is louder than tears. <br>
When you are invisible, <br>
the only way to prove you exist, is to hurt yourself, not your lovers. <br>
