<div align="left">

My Name is Sam, and I am hollow. <br>
So, you can blame your fault on me.<br>
You can accuse me, call me names, and watch me watch you from the shadow.<br>
Not because I am incapable of understanding your intentions, or the fact that you are shallow,<br>
but because my name is Sam, and I am hollow.<br><br>

Like when I am dragging myself over the crosswalk to go home after seeking refuge in the emergency room of a hospital for wanting to put out my light,<br>
and you have made an error in choosing your lane <br>
and are blocking the car behind that is honking to complain, <br>
and you shout at me "Move your ass" twice to pressure me to run, so that you can change your lane right behind the traffic light. <br><br>

Like when there is still 8 seconds left from my green light, <br>
and you misuse a mano a borsa and shout at me like a person in the right, <br>
and I just watch you. <br>
Probably because I always find it hard to understand how life can be accommodating and even generous with those like you. <br>
But most likely because my name is Sam, and I am hollow.<br><br>

It is not because I don't want to respond, or I can't understand you for the person that you are. <br>
It is because by the time I analyze the situation and figure the depth of your selfishness, you will be long gone, <br>
relieved of your anger and archiving the memory as the fault of a lazy bum. <br>
It is because by the time I categorize you as a successful businessman, you will be on the highway enjoying your loud music and reigning the world with your unlimited arrogance.<br>
It is because by the time I finalize scanning the experience for my mistakes and find none, <br>
you will have reached the conclusion that the mistake was mine, <br>
and will have carried on with your life, unchanged and guilt-free.<br>

All because my name is Sam, and I am hollow.<br><br>
