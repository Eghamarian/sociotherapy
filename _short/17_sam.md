<div align="left">

My Name is Sam and I am hollow. So, you can blame your shit on me.<br>
You can accuse me, call me names, and watch me watch you in return.<br>
Not because I am incapable of understanding your intentions, or the fact that you are shallow,<br>
but because my name is Sam and I am hollow.<br> <br>

Like when I am draggin myself over the crossroad to go home after seeking refuge in the emergency room of the hospital for wanting to kill myself,<br>
and you have made an error in choosing your lane, and are blocking the car behind you, and he is honking in protest, and you shout at me "Move your ass", so that I move faster, so that you can change your lane right behind the trafic light.<br>
You can misuse a mano a borsa, and shout at me like a person in the right, teaching a person in the wrong, and I will not respond. <br><br>
Because my name is Sam and I am hollow.<br><br>

It is not because I don't want to respond, or I can't understand the problem. It is because by the time I analyze the situation and figure the depth of your selfishness, you will be long gone, relieved of your anger and archiving the memory as the fault of a lazy bum. <br>
It is because by the time I categorize you as a successful businessman, you will be on the highway enjoying your loud music and reigning the world with your continued arrogance.<br>
It is because by the time I finalize scanning the experience for my mistake and find none, you will have reached a conclusion that I was to blame and will have carried on with your life, guilt-free.<br><br>
All because my name is Sam and I am hollow.<br>
