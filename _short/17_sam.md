My Name is Sam, and I am hollow. So, you can blame your shit on me.<br>
You can accuse me, call me names, and watch me watch you in return.<br>
Not because I am incapable of understanding your intentions, or the fact that you are shallow,<br>
but because my name is Sam, and I am hollow.<br> <br>

Like when I am draggin myself over the crosswalk to go home after seeking refuge in the emergency room of a hospital for wanting to kill myself,<br>
and you have made an error in choosing your lane and are blocking the car behind you that is honking in protest, and you shout at me "Move your ass" twice, so that I move faster, so that you can change your lane right behind the trafic light. <br>
Like when there is still 16 seconds left from my light turning red, and you misuse a mano a borsa and shout at me like a person in the right, teaching a person in the wrong, and I do not respond. <br>
Probably because I always find it hard to believe people like you can exist.<br><br>
But most likely because my name is Sam, and I am hollow.<br><br>

It is not because I don't want to respond, or I can't understand the problem. It is because by the time I analyze the situation and figure the depth of your selfishness, you will be long gone, relieved of your anger and archiving the memory as the fault of a lazy bum. <br>
It is because by the time I categorize you as a successful businessman, you will be on the highway enjoying your loud music and reigning the world with your continued arrogance.<br>
It is because by the time I finalize scanning the experience for my mistake and find none, you will have reached a conclusion that mistake was mine, and will have carried on with your life, guilt-free.<br><br>
All because my name is Sam, and I am hollow.<br>
