<div align="left">

She rids herself of me,<br>
I begin to struggle,<br>
Pointlessly,<br>
She is only present in body to bid farewell,<br>
No soul, no room for discussions,<br>
The end began last year, she says,<br>
She has been hinting me of her despair for a year,<br>
I was consumed by me then, it appears.<br>
She has skinned now, <br>
And I have fallen with it,<br>
Left behind, decomposing in dirt and rain,<br><br>

A year after, I am diagnosed with Autism,<br>
I am not good at receiving hints it seems,<br>
But don’t take me for an example,<br>
It has taken me 40 years to begin to see, and that is not always true still.<br>
Even if I was normal, I am a man;<br>
a diagnosable condition in itself,<br>
Men are often short-sighted,<br>
So if you are just beginning to send clues,<br>
Let go of Hollywood,<br>
Forget Instagram,<br>
If you love him, sit him down, and tell him things are piling up,<br>
Tell him you will leave in one year, if he doesn’t acknowledge your struggles,<br>
If you really love him, gently teach him how to do it,<br>
He will do it, <br>
Unless he is like me.<br><br>
