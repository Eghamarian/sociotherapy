<div align="left">

Right where we stand, there's patience to be had, <br>
There are hopes to unloose,<br>
There are  ways to unchoose.<br>
There is a vision to revive, <br>
If there is a will to survive. <br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, hatred's getting out of hand,<br>
There are fists to unclench,<br>
There's pain to withstand,<br>
There is anger to unleash,<br>
There are kids to unteach, <br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, the Earth's dying under feet,<br>
There are trees to uncut,<br>
There are seas to undump,<br>  
There's a globe to unheat.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, there's love to go round, <br>
But there are knees to unbend,<br>
There are wounds to unbound,<br>
There are hearts to unbreak,<br>
There are arms to embrace.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, there's truth to be told,<br>
But there are chests to unchain,<br>
There are gates to unclose,<br>
There are laws to uphold.<br><br>
  
Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>
