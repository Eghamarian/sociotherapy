<div align="left">

Right where we stand, there is patience to be had, <br>
There is a vision to revive, <br>
There is a will to survive. <br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, there are fists to unclench,<br>
There are kids to unteach, <br>
There is anger to unleash.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, there is pain to endure,<br>
There are hopes to unloose,<br>
There are  ways to unchoose.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br>
<br>
Right where we stand, there is the Earth underneath,<br>
There are woods to uncut,<br>
There is a globe to unheat.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, there is love to go round, <br>
There are knees to unbend,<br>
There are wounds to unbound,<br>
There are hearts to unbreak,<br>
There are arms to embrace.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>

Right where we stand, there is truth to be told,<br>
There are chests to unchain,<br>
There are gates to unclose.<br><br>

Right, as we try, <br>
Wrong, as we give in.<br><br>
