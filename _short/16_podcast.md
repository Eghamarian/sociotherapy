My life is like a podcast episode. You hit play and tuck yourslef in bed, but miss the beginning because your mind wanders off. You then untuck yourself, rewind the episode to its beginning, and tuck yourself back in, just to find your mind wander off again. My life is exactly the same with two major differences. With a podcase episode, you can rewind it as many times as you want. The worst that can happen is you loosing a few minutes of your sleep. With my life, it's not that simple. What I miss is often an amazing chance at romance, an opportunity to kick start a wonderful career, or the possibility to settle somewhere with a lot of potential for a good life. You can't rewind these, and even if you somehow manage, your options will almost certainly be different. I did it once. And although the new options were as great, I missed them for the second time, and dived into my deepest depression to date. <br><br>
  
The second difference is that, with you being you, you may be able to let go of what you missed for the second or third time, and focus on the rest of the podcast, with a "fuck it" mentality. With me being me, that is almost certainly not an option. If that happens, I am unlikely to be able to focus on the rest of the podcast, unless I rewind it as many times as necessary, and  until I get what I missed. Horrible, I know. <br><br>
  
I also know that I repeat myself all the time. Not only in my life, but also in talking about it. If you browse through my writings, you easily realize I nag about the same things over and over again. In my defense, I am in pain, and by writing about them, I am trying to get rid of the pain; often invain. <br><br>
  
I can't help but imagine the kind of thoughts that pass through your mind when reading my rubbish too. This is another malfunction I have that is meant to have two functions. Not being good at reading people, I have spend a substantial chunk of my time figuring out how they think. It has been helping me interpret their messages and intentions with mild success. The second function of my malfunction, is to compensate for my lack of foresight. Not being able to see the consequences of my decisions, I have been internalizing voices in my head. Every time a decision comes to my mind, I imagine sharing it with people I normally talk to, and listen to their comments modelled by my mind. Most often, I predict their answers accurately, but their voices have rarely saved me from creating a new crisis, or sabotaging my chance of success. Perhaps one can only succeed following other people's ideas if one follows them fully and to the end. My failure has often been due to mixing their ideas with those of mine, thus creating a mixed path that is neither theirs nor mine. For the fun of it, let me give you three groups I am imagining to respond to my rants above. <br><br>
  
The first group are my self-made friends who take pride in giving me tough love, by being honest with me. They would say: "Why are all your stories about you, you, you. Maybe you should let go of your ego for a change and focus on what's real around you."<br><br>

I usually find this difficult to understand. If it means "consider other people when living your life", I have tried and failed; sometimes because I misinterpreted their preferences, and other times because I couldn't complete the task I didn't choose. In on the other hand, they mean "consider the financial and career-related ramifications of your decision", I have also tried and failed. I often fail at this for two reasons; one is when I engage in activities I do not enjoy, and othe other is when the conditions for success is beyond my capacity. The first one is obvious and happens to eveyone. Apparently society is tolerant for people in their 20s to find their interest through trial and error, as far as they don't take too long. I did the same and found a couple of things I am interested in. But then I learned that success in our time is exclusively synonymous with pushing yourself to the limits. It invariably means you have to be ready to tear yourself up in order to compete and stand out. It befalls you to create demand for your skills through perseverence and excellence. I hate competition with a passion and there is nothing I enjoy enough to be ready to myself up for it. <br><br>
  
The second group are those who are also self-made, often by playing by the rules and sacrificing their own passions. This group, which are hated by my family, would encourage me to pursue my passion because life is short. What they don't realise, and my family does, is that from the outside, this is what it looks I have been doing. This group often know what they wanted but could not get due to circumstances, and they project their capacities onto me. They think if I look for my passion, it will soon be clear to me, just as their passion is to them, and then I can make a career out of it. But they do not know I have problems with both stages; finding my passion, and having consistency pursuing it. That said, this group is the most fun to listen to, now that I know I should not take their words seriously. It would be even more fun to fantacise with then with a bear and some nuts perhaps. I used to listen to them though. 
  
Another group, which involves my family, would try to guide me in the right direction with more gentle words. They would say, "Why don't you start now? It is never late. The fact that you know this, is wonderful. Learn from the past, and move forward with a fresh start." But what this group don't realize is that I cannot continue when I have missed the beginning of the podcast. They often remain gentle for some time, but in the end they accuse me of blocking every path they lay ahead of me. Then they loose their tempor and say, "You find a problem with every solution we lay before you. Perhaps you do not want to solve your problems after all. Do whatever you want."<br><br>

That is why, I keep untucking myself, rewinding the podcast to its beginning, and miss it again, and again, and again. And in doing so, I loose my friends and family, drain my resources, and end up being a nobody; alone and dreamy. And dreams are the biggest distractions when you are trying to focus on a podcast. <br><br>
