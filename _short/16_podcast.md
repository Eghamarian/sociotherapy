My life is like a podcast episode. You hit play and tuck yourslef in bed, but miss the beginning because your mind wanders off. You then untuck yourself, rewind the episode to its beginning, and tuck yourself back in, just to find your mind wander off again. My life is exactly the same with two major differences. <br>
With a podcase episode, you can rewind it as many times as you want. The worst that can happen is you loosing a few minutes of your sleep. With my life, it's not that simple. What I miss is often an amazing chance at romance, or an opportunity to kick start a wonderful career, or the possibility to settle somewhere with a lot of potential for a good life. You can't rewind these, and even if you somehow manage, your options will almost certainly be different. I did it once. And although the new options were as great, I missed them for the second time, and dived into my deepest depression to date. <br><br>
  
The second difference is that, with you being you, you may be able to let go of what you missed for the second or third time, and focus on the rest of the podcast, with a "fuck it" mentality. With me being me, that is almost certainly not an option. If that happens, I am unlikely to be able to focus on the rest of the podcast, unless I rewind it as many times as necessary, and  until I get what I missed. Horrible, I know. I also know that I repeat myself all the time. Not only in my life, but also in talking about it. If you browse through my writings, you easily realize I nag about the same things over and over again. In my defense, I am in pain, and by writing about them, I am trying to get rid of the pain. Often invain. <br><br>
  
I can't help but imagine the kind of thoughts that pass through your mind when reading my rubbish too. This is another malfunction I have developed to serve two purposes. Not being good at reading people, I have spend a substantial chunk of my time figuring out how they think. It has been helping me interpret their messages and intentions with mild success. The second function of my malfunction, is to compensate for my lack of foresight. Not being able to see the consequences of my decisions, I have been internalizing voices in my head. Every time a decision comes to my mind, I imagine sharing it with people I know well, and listen to their feedback. Most often, I predict their answers accurately, but their voices have rarely saved me from creating a new crisis, and prevented me from sabotaging my chance of success. One can only succeed following other people's ideas if one follows them fully and to the end. My failure has often been due to mixing their ideas with those of mine, thus creating a mixed path that is neither here nor there. For the fun of it, let me give you two groups I am imagining to respond to my rants above. <br><br>
  
The first group are my self-made friends who take pride in giving me tough love, by being honest with me. They would say: "Why are all your stories about you, you, you. Maybe you should let go of your ego for a change and focus on what's real around you."<br><br>

I usually find this difficult to understand. If it means "consider other people when living your life", I have tried and failed; sometimes because I misinterpreted their preferences, and other times because I couldn't complete the task becasue the decision was not mine. <br><br>
  
Another group, which involves my family, would try to guide me in the right direction with more gentle words. They would say, "Why don't you start now? It is never late. The fact that you know this, is wonderful. Learn from the past, and move forward with a fresh start." But they don't realize that I cannot continue, because I have missed the beginning of the podcast. They often remain gentle for some time, but in the end they accuse me of blocking every path they lay ahead of me. Then they loose their tempor and say, "You find an problem with every solution we lay before you. Perhaps you do not want to solve your problems after all. Do whatever you want."<br><br>

That is why, I keep untucking myself, rewinding the podcast to its beginning, and miss it again, and again, and again. And in doing so, I loose my friends and my family, drain my resources, and end up being a nobody; alone and dreamy. And dreams are the biggest distractions when you are trying to focus on a podcast. <br><br>
