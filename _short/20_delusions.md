<div align="left">

Desert sun burns your soul,<br>
Beg, and it won’t let go,<br>
Cold will soon take over,<br>
The clothes you dropped while ago,<br><br>
<!--Don’t die in desert from cold,<br><br>-->

Run where you run,<br>
Rest when you’re done,<br>
Just a little, <br>
Or sleep in a corner if you find one,<br><br>
  
Look around, you'll see things,<br>
Don’t rob your eyes, <br>
Or rub them if you disbelieve them,<br>
Hazy? <br>
Natural. Take this pill and you will dream of daisies. <br><br>

But doctor, how about the pain?<br>
How long have you been smoking for?<br>
So that’s what it comes down to, <br>
Look after your goals, and nightmares will look after themselves. <br><br>

Your eyes tearful and dry, your lips colourless and blind,<br>
Go back to your cave,<br>
No TV for one day,<br>
The dream you dropped while ago,<br><br>
<!--Don’t care for less or more, what good is it if you can’t take hold.<br> <br>-->

When in desert, snakes are friends,<br>
Talk to them,<br>
Don’t eat them if you do,<br> 
Be an animal just this once. <br><br>  
  
Raise your hand,<br>
Or kill the thought if you can't,<br>
Together they will drain you,<br>
Do if you do, don't if you don't,<br>
Anything goes here in nomansland.<br><br>

The life you dropped while ago,<br>
What a life it was, don't hope for another chance.<br>
Just loosen your grip.<br>
Let go,<br>
Let go.  <br><br>
