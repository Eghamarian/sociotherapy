It's not physical, yet I can put my finger on it. <br>
I can show where it hurts. <br>
It's at the center of my stomach, right below my chest. <br>
It's not painful either, it is just hollow. <br>
It feels like my core is evaporating like effervescent vitamins. <br>
But unlike vitamin tablets, my evaporating core doesn't get lighter and lighter until it disappears. <br>
It gets heavier and heavier as it pulls my entire existance towards it. <br>
It devours all my resources, and leaves me crumpled and numb. <br><br>
  
How did I sabotage my chance, when I could feel the breath of perfection on my neck? <br>
She showed interest, she was pretty and intelligent. <br>
I was nervous, pedantic, uncharacteristically judgmental, and absent. <br>
I partly blame anti-depressant medications; they made me cold and indifferent. <br>
I have now stopped them, but it took me two years to realize it.<br>
It takes me two years to realize everything, not just matters of the heart. <br>
This is why I find it less productive to focus on future or present. <br>
No matter how hard I try, I always see things only in retrospect. <br>
And this is why instead of a windscreen, I have put a huge mirror in front of me. <br> 
So looking ahead, invariably shows me the past. <br>
What is the point of looking when I can't see? <br>
At least I can see things when I look in the mirror. <br>  <br>

This is also why I often ask others what they see ahead of me; <br> 
then I listen, and imagine, and decide based on how the image feels. <br>
Sometimes they are right, but most often they are wrong. <br>
I guess no one can see for you; not even your family. <br>
<!--When they are right, I wish I had listened to them; <br>
and when they are wrong, they give me a good understanding of how they see me. <br>-->
Even those who are right about mine, are wrong about their own paths sometimes. <br>
But when that happens, they don't stop. <br>
They don't stop and think about what could be; they keep moving and think about what may be. <br>
We all make mistakes, but the difference between us, them and I, is that they have their mirror behind them. <br>
So, even when they try to look back and see what's passed, they mostly see what's to come. <br> 
Their connection with the past is often a bunch of lessons they carry forward with them. <br>
For me, the past is the only world I understand, so I've just settled there. <br>
I do wish though; <br>
I wish I could put my mirror behind, or drive backwards so my rearsightedness would reverse. <br>
But some people are just born without foresight. <br>
And before you say it, I have tried. I have also tried harder. <br>
