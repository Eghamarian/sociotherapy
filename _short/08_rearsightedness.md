<div align="center">

It's not physical, yet I can put my finger on it. <br>
I can show where it hurts. <br>
It's at the center of my stomach, right below my chest. <br>
It's not painful either, it is just hollow. <br>
It feels like my core is evaporating like effervescent vitamins. <br>
But unlike vitamin tablets, my evaporating core doesn't get lighter and lighter until it disappears. <br>
It gets heavier and heavier as it pulls my entire existance towards it. <br>
It devours all my resources, and leaves me numb. <br><br>
  
How did I sabotage my chance, when I could feel the breath of perfection on my neck? <br>
She showed interest, she was pretty and intelligent. <br>
I was pedantic, uncharacteristically judgmental, and absent. <br>
I partly blame anti-depressant medications. They made me cold and indifferent. <br>
I have now stopped them, but it took me two years to realize all this.<br>
It takes me two years to realize everything. <br>
This is why I find it less productive to focus on present or future. <br>
No matter how hard I try, I always realize things in retrospect. <br>
And this is why instead of a windscreen, I have a huge mirror in front of me, so looking ahead invariably shows me the past. <br>
What is the point of looking when I can't see, right? At least I can see things when I look in the mirror. <br>
And before you say it, I have tried. I have also tried harder. <br>
