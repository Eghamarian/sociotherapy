<div align="center">

I wish I could paint. <br>
If I could, I'd paint my demon, to bring it to eye level; <br>
to make it smaller, easier to imagine, and less formidable; <br>
to make it look into my eyes, and tear it up with a cutter when my pain is unbearable. <br>
I wish I could paint my dreams, to make them more reachable; <br>
to bring them to life, to keep them alive, or at least make them visible.<br>
I wish I could paint my fever, fervour and soul, to make them more tractable; <br>
to make them less suppressed and enfeeble.<br>
But I can't paint.
