<div align="center">

From the watch tower, he watches over the border through his rifle's scope; <br>
a border that is indiscerinible, if not for the wall. <br>   
He has been instructed to keep watchful eyes, ever since his army invaded the neighbours last year. <br>
Famine and disease are roaring on the other side, and refugees are expected to rise. <br>
He has been instructed to shout, to shout, and if not listened to, to shoot.<br>
But he never finds enough time. Parents creep up from the other side, and throw their kids over the wall. <br>
The kid in the air hears him, but cannot freeze. <br>
But the soldier in the tower can and does; at first. <br>
It feels like Game of Thrones, where the dead are climbing up the wall at Kings Landing. <br>
But he somehow knows that was a movie, we all hope. <br>  
Bored and mind-tripping at Hollywood, he thinks to himself, and thanks his president for the wall. <br>
Although some manage to cross, the wall keeps away the men, the air, the polution, the bacteria, the viruses, and the hatred. <br>
He thanks his president in his mind, kisses his cross necklace, filld with pride, <br> and shouts, <br> and shouts. <br>
