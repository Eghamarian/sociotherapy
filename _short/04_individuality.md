<div align="center">



I always thought I was immature and I hated myself for it.<br>
But the entire humanity does it, and does it often.<br>
We all want things at times;<br>
We all want things so bad at times, we fight for them,<br>
We want them so bad, we kill for them. <br>
But then we realize, if we are wise, we were no different than kids on tantrums, demanding what they do not need.<br>
Individuality is one of those.<br>
We wanted it so bad, we tore all the common threads connecting us to each other.<br>
Now we long for common values more than ever.<br>
But since we got rid of all publis interests, our private interests are showcasing on public stage.<br>
Out iindividual loneliness is on piblc display.<br>
Even out most intimate moments are appreciated proportional to the number of views or likes they get.<br> 

We yearn for acknowledgment so much, that we are uncertain whether we experience thing, unless it is seen and liked.<br><br>

This conversation is already not, or will soon stop to be, strange:<br><br>
  
<em>I touch myself here, and you touch yourself there.<br>
We then split the screen; I take half, and you, the other half.<br>
We will decide how fulfilling it was after we count the likes. </em><br><br>
  
I thought I was immature, and I hated myself for it.<br>
But the entire humanity does it, and does it often.<br>
