I always thought I was immature and I hated myself for it.
But the entire humanity does it, and does it often.
We all want things at times;
We all want things so bad at times, we fight for them,
We want them so bad, we kill for them. 
But then we realize, if we are wise, we were no different than a kid on a tantrum, demanding what they do not need.
Individuality is one of those.
We wanted it so bad, we tore all the common threads connecting us to each other.
Now we long for common values more than ever.
But since we got rid of all publis interests, our private interests are showcasing on public stage.
Even out most intimate moments are appreciated proportional to the number of views or likes they get. 
We yearn for acknowledgment so much that we are uncertain whether we experience thing unless it is seen and approved by public.
I thought I was immature, and I hated myself for it.
But the entire humanity does it, and does it often.
