Lucy is lying on her back, with her bottom towards the camera. Her knees are bent, her legs are crossed, her left foot is dangling in the air, and except for a tiny ribbon covered by her white thong, her bottom-half goodies are entirely on display. She has half a Dilmote in her pussy, and the other half is sticking out from the left side of the tiny ribbon covering her cunt. Dilmote is a remote dildo that vibrates when a viewers tips us. The higher their tip, the more intense the vibration. On top, she is wearing a white babydoll lingerie to match her white thong and white nail polish. She is checking her SnapChat above her face. I am wearing black boxer shorts, and am lying on my left side, facing the camera. But I am looking at my phone because I am reeling on instagram and can't stop. <br><br>
  
We have been streaming on Cum'n Chat for an hour now, and we seem to have 273 viewers in our room, but nothing has been happening. I reckon most of the viewers are bots, and the rest are penniless folks, who are there to watch us having sex at other people's expense. But that's ok because we are not on the platform for money. But no one is talking to us and that is why we are not doing what we came here to do. Normally people who do not tip do not engage in coversation. I have no idea why but that may be because they feel obliged to contribute if you read their messages and respond to them. I may be wrong; all I know is that they don't engage in conversations as much as those who tip. And so far, no one has been talking to us, which is why we are not sure those watching are humans or bots. No one even answers our questions. So, we are just hanging around until someone says something or tips so we know someone is watching.<br><br>
  
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the platform, Cum'n Chat is a platform, where performers stream sexual content, and viewers view and tip the performers. Like other social media platforms, Cum'n Chat has other stuff for folks to interact too; things like following, liking, rating, reporting, emojis, and all the rest of it. It's a funny place, Cum'n Chat. It is a smaller virtual sample of the real world. Performers come from all walks of life; some are real couples like Lucy and I, some are professional porn performers, some are current or ex-sex workers who have discovered the platform and are excited to earn a living from the comfort of their homes and some are perverts or simply looking for some excitement. All these people get on the platform and compete with each other to get more viewers. Their ideals is to have more loyal viewers and fans, because that means every time they come on, their fans logon to watch them, and tip them for their performance. But like in the real life, distribuion of chance is not equitable. It seems that prettier folks invariably have more followers. So, from the start, some people are much ahead of others in the game.  <br><br>
  
Some people manage to counter this inequality by engaging in exotic activities like getting an elaborate fuck machine, or forcing themselves to squirt after a certain amount of tips or just staying online and waiting for the pretty ones to go to bed and then fish for viewers. But the problem is that the same possibilities are available to the more attractive people, and they never fail to take advantage of such opportunities. I have seen top models on the platform streaming for 12 hours straight. How do I know this? They said it in their streams. <br><br>

But as I said, Lucy and I are not on here for the money. We had the idea as a solution to our problem of late. A couple of years through our marriage, I started loosing interest in our sexual relationship. I still loved her, and even found her sexy, but not as passionately as the first day we met. In the beginning, I could worship her for an entire weekend, or even a week if I had time. But now I need a reason to be turned on. Our sex is not automatic and natural. It feels effortful and planned. She did not feel the same though. Or maybe she did, but did not show it. I was the exact opposite. I started to panic. I began questioning our relationship, my love for her, and whether I had made the right choice. This would often get to a point that I would go online and watch other people have sex to see how having sex looks like among couples, and whether I would be turned on by watching them. This is how I came across Cum'n Jack, which marked the beginning of our emotional roller coster. <br><br>

My findings on Cum'n Chat were consistently worrisome.  First of all, most couple on the platform seemed extremely passionate towards each other, although they had been together for a few years. My second worrisome discovery was that I was invariably turned on by watching them have sex on my screen, which would make me doubt my relationship even further. I did not discuss this with Lucy immediately. I was busy panicking, and making things even worse by going back to Cum'n Chat more often. It was my obsession with Cum'n Chat which aroused Lucy’s curiosity and lead to us having a serious talk. That was the first time we started talking about my coldness too. I did not know what to tell her; what I was feeling was embarrassing, uncomfortable to talk about and arguably just wrong. But I had no other choice. She had questions and I had to answer them. So, I shared my thoughts and feelings with her and we decide to get professional help. <br><br>

We didn’t know what kind of help I needed though. Did we have to go see a sex therapist or a psychotherapist? Which type of psychotherapy was the most appropriate method to choose? Could my family doctor help? Did I need medication? We did not think so, because I had no physical dysfunction. This is why we started searching online to get some idea about where to start. A few days later, I stumbled upon a problem called ROCD, short for relationship OCD. ROCD is a subcategory of a more general condition called primarily obsessional OCD, which is different to traditional OCD in that the underlying fear and the compulsions that are deployed to ameliorate the fear are cognitive in nature. For example, if in a person with a traditional OCD is afraid of illness, a person with POCD could be afraid of falling out of love with their partner, or be fearful of hurting them physically or emotionally. Similarly, to deal with the anxiety resulting from the dreadful thought, the person with traditional OCD engages in repetative washing and cleaning to fight germs for example. However, the person with POCD starts ruminating about the consequences of their fear being a valid fear. This is precisely why some people believe POCD is harder to treat because it is harder to detect. Most people are able to realize they are worried about falling out love with a partner, but they may not realize they are suffering from a form of OCD because they do not realize their rumination, or constant worrying, is a compulsive side of their OCD. <br><br>

When Lucy and I found about this, we decided that mu symptoms were very similar to what is described by ROCD; the doubting, the questioning, the checking, etc. Lucy agreed with me on this and we looked for a specialist in the field, which was not an easy task considering it is a new branch of research. But we finally managed, and booked an appointment with the therapist. At the end of first session with the therapist, she confirmed my condition was ROCD and that we were in the right place. We were relived on the one hand because help was on the way, and scared because we did not know exactly what were the consequences of the condition. But the therapist assured us that there are ways to control the situation and gradually get back to our normal life before I was hit by ROCD. The problem was that we needed a lot of patience. A few session into our therapy, we discovered that available treatments focus on rewiring brain connections through behavioural changes. But it turns out this could take years to work. For example, my exercise was to refrain from going on Cum'n Chat to check whether I would be aroused by the sight of other people having sex. My other exercise was to actually entertain the idea that Lucy was not the one for me, and sit face to face with the stress this thought would generate inside me, without enacting on it. This was all good. I was happy to face my demons and go through the resultant discomfort of dealing with my anxiety. But Lucy could not just wait for me to recover, especially since talking about my condition made things worse for some reason. While we had not talked about it, I would manage to pull through and have a decent sex with her once or twice a week. But since we opened the can of worms, we reluctantly have sex once every two weeks. <br><br>
