Beggar: "Sir? Good Sir? Would you spare me some change please?" <br>
Sir to his Boss, as they walk out of the building: "We seriously need to consider their offer. It’s not like we come across an opportunity like this everyday. Besides, …"<br>
Beggar: "Pardon me sir? I am homeless and starving. Would you spare me some change please?"<br>
Sir to beggar: "Sorry." <br>
Sir to his Boss: "Besides, even if the market crashes, we are insured and get compensated."<br>
Beggar: "Sir, I have a good voice sir. If it pleases you, I can sing for you for a fiver sir. I haven’t eaten for three days sir."<br>
Boss to sir: "That’s a bargain", chuckles the good sir. <br>
Sir to his Boss: "A concert for a fiver? Not too bad, is it?", comments the good sir to show he is not ignoring the beggar now that his Boss is acknowledging him. He even plays along and pulls another joke. Anything for the Boss to push that deal. <br>
Sir: "What would you do for a quid? Could you moon walk?" Chuckles the good sir and looks at his Boss for approval that he did well, and that they are a team. <br>
Beggar: "I don’t think I can moon walk sir. But I could stand on my head, if it pleases you sir. I’m just a bit dizzy sir." <br>
Sir and his Boss whisper in each others’ ears and reach a consensus, it looks as if.<br>
Sir: "Ok, here is a tenner. I want you to go to that gentlemen in blue suit having a beer outside that pub, and tell him Margarett is lonely."<br>
Beggar looks at the tenner in disbelief, and wants to do more for the gentleman. But the good sir blocks him.<br>
Sir: "No need for a hug, just go to him and tell him that". <br>
Beggar: "Margarett..", <br>
Sir and the beggar simultaneously: "is lonely".<br>
Sir: "That's right."<br>
Beggar nods violently to show he has understood the task fully, hides the tenner somewhere secure and moves towards the blue-suited-sir. Midway he looks back to give a thumbs up showing the sirs are getting their money’s worth, and receives thumbs up in return from behind cellphone cameras.<br>
Beggar: "Sir? Um, Good day sir. I apologize for intruding your conversation sir. I'd like to let you know that, um, Margarett is lonely sir".<br>
Blue-suited-sir feels all the beer he has had rushing to his face, and throws the rest of it the beggar's face. The bouncer rushes to shoo the beggar who is busy licking the beer off his beard. And it’s a good beer, if he may say so.  <br>
Beggar: "Sir, I am awfully sorry sir." He means it. <br>
He wants to look at the generous sirs to confirm the deed is done, but is afraid to breech the confidentiality clause. He subtly peeks at them, and the sirs are waving at the blue-suited-sir voluntarily, as if to let him know if was them. He doesn’t know the game that the rich play. But they don't seem to mind, so he gives them one last thumbs up, and thinks about how to divide the tenner between food and some sort of pain killer. <br><br>

You don’t think it’s possible, do you? Well, you should, because it is. I know a rich man from a rich family, who you don't get to meet unless you have good connections. He is extremely confident and proud of his accomplishments. One of these accomplishments is defecating on a sheet of newspaper with his friends when they were kids, and throwing the turd out the window by suddenly pulling the newspaper from both sides, making it look like a turd jumping on a paper trampoline, and watching to see if it landed on those walking below. He no longer does that with a real turd, and if he does, he no longer tells me about it. But does tell me that he sleeps with a new woman every week, and let's his wife think he is on business trips and in business meetings. When I ask him why, he says it is because his job is hard, and that his wife does not have similar needs anyway. This is while he does not let men, including me, meet with his wife. So the turd is metaphorical now, but is a turd nonetheless. <br><br>
  
And I know a few university graduates who, through no fault of their own, fell victim to destitution, and are now homeless. I can't give you names, but I can refer you to a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/InvisiblePeople" target="_blank">Invisible People </a>, if you don't believe me, and if you wish to see some of them yourself. But remember, people on Invisible People are not beggars. Most are too dignified, too shy or too weak to ask for help. My story is not about them. The focus of my story is the rich, not the poor. Here is an example of a homeless university graduate. <br><br>
