Beggar: "Sir? Good Sir? Would you spare me some change please?" <br>
Sir to his friend sir: "We seriously need to consider their offer. It’s not like we come across an opportunity like this everyday. Besides, …"<br>
Beggar: "Pardon me sir? I am homeless and starving. Would you spare me some change please?"<br>
Sir to beggar: "Sorry." <br>
Sir to his friend sir: "Besides, even if the market crashes, we are insured and we get compensated."<br>
Beggar: "Sir, I have a good voice sir. If it pleases you, I can sing for you for you for a fiver sir. I haven’t eaten for three days sir."<br>
His friend sir to sir: "That’s a bargain", chuckles the good sir. <br>
Sir to his friend sir: "A concert for a fiver? Not too bad, is it?", Comments the good sir to show he is not ignoring the beggar now that his friend sir is acknowledging him. He even plays along and pulls another joke. Anything for the friend sir to take that deal. <br>
Sir: "What would you do for a quid? Could you moon walk?" Chuckles the good sir and looks at his friend sir for approval that he did well and that they are a team. <br>
Beggar: "I don’t know what that is sir. But I could stand on me 'ed, if it pleases you sir. I’m just a bit dizzy sir." <br>
Sir and his friend sir whisper in each others’ ears and reach a consensus, it looks as if.<br>
Sir: "Ok, here is a tenner. I want you to go to that gentlemen in blue suit having a beer outside the pub, and tell him Margarett is lonely."<br>
Beggar looks at the tenner, and wants to do more for the gentleman. But Sir, pushes him back.<br>
Sir: "No need for a hug, just go to him and tell him that".<br>
Beggar: "Margarett..", <br>
Sir and the beggar simultaneously: "is lonely".<br>
Sir: "That's right."<br>
Beggar looks nods violently to show he has understood the task fully, hides the tenner somewhere secure and moves towards the blue-suited-sir. Midway he looks back to give a thumbs up showing the sirs are getting their money’s worth, and receives thumbs up in return from behind cellphone cameras.<br>
Beggar: "Sir? Um, Good day sir. I apologize for intruding your conversation sir. I'd like to let you know that, um, Margarett is lonely sir".<br>
Blue-suited-sir feels all the beer he as had rushing to his brain, and throws the rest of it in his face. The bouncer rushes to shoo the beggar who is busy licking the beer of his beard. And it’s a good beer if he may say so.  <br>
Beggar: "Sir, I am awfully sorry sir."<br>
He wants to look at the generous sirs to let them know the deed is done, but is afraid to breech the confidentiality clause. But the sirs are waving at the blue-suited-sir voluntarily. He doesn’t know the game that the rich play. So, thinkings it’s ok, he gives them one last thumbs up and thinks about how to divide the tenner between food and some sort of pain killer. <br><br>
