Beggar: "Sir? Good Sir? Would you spare me some change please?" <br>
Sir to his friend sir, as they walk out of the building: "We seriously need to consider their offer. It’s not like we come across an opportunity like this everyday. Besides, …"<br>
Beggar: "Pardon me sir? I am homeless and starving. Would you spare me some change please?"<br>
Sir to beggar: "Sorry." <br>
Sir to his friend sir: "Besides, even if the market crashes, we are insured and get compensated."<br>
Beggar: "Sir, I have a good voice sir. If it pleases you, I can sing for you for a fiver sir. I haven’t eaten for three days sir."<br>
His friend sir to sir: "That’s a bargain", chuckles the good sir. <br>
Sir to his friend sir: "A concert for a fiver? Not too bad, is it?", comments the good sir to show he is not ignoring the beggar now that his friend sir is acknowledging him. He even plays along and pulls another joke. Anything for the friend sir to push that deal. <br>
Sir: "What would you do for a quid? Could you moon walk?" Chuckles the good sir and looks at his friend sir for approval that he did well, and that they are a team. <br>
Beggar: "I don’t think I can moon walk sir. But I could stand on my head, if it pleases you sir. I’m just a bit dizzy sir." <br>
Sir and his friend sir whisper in each others’ ears and reach a consensus, it looks as if.<br>
Sir: "Ok, here is a tenner. I want you to go to that gentlemen in blue suit having a beer outside that pub, and tell him Margarett is lonely."<br>
Beggar looks at the tenner in disbelief, and wants to do more for the gentleman. But the good sir blocks him.<br>
Sir: "No need for a hug, just go to him and tell him that". <br>
Beggar: "Margarett..", <br>
Sir and the beggar simultaneously: "is lonely".<br>
Sir: "That's right."<br>
Beggar nods violently to show he has understood the task fully, hides the tenner somewhere secure and moves towards the blue-suited-sir. Midway he looks back to give a thumbs up showing the sirs are getting their money’s worth, and receives thumbs up in return from behind cellphone cameras.<br>
Beggar: "Sir? Um, Good day sir. I apologize for intruding your conversation sir. I'd like to let you know that, um, Margarett is lonely sir".<br>
Blue-suited-sir feels all the beer he has had rushing to his face, and throws the rest of it the beggar's face. The bouncer rushes to shoo the beggar who is busy licking the beer off his beard. And it’s a good beer, if he may say so.  <br>
Beggar: "Sir, I am awfully sorry sir." He means it. <br>
He wants to look at the generous sirs to confirm the deed is done, but is afraid to breech the confidentiality clause. He subtly peeks at them, and the sirs are waving at the blue-suited-sir voluntarily, as if to let him know if was them. He doesn’t know the game that the rich play. But they don't seem to mind, so he gives them one last thumbs up, and thinks about how to divide the tenner between food and some sort of pain killer. <br><br>

You don’t think it’s possible, do you? Well, you should, because it is. I know a rich man, proud of his accomplishments, who used to defecate on a sheet of newspaper with his friends when they were kids, and throw the turd out the window by suddenly pulling the newspaper from both sides, making it look like a turd jumping on a paper trampoline, and watch to see if it landed on the head of those walking below. Games the rich play.<br><br>
  
And I know a few university graduates who, through no fault of their own, fell victim to destitution and are now homeless. I can give you names, but I can refer you to a YouTube channel called Invisible People, if you wish to see some of these people, and if you don't believe me. Here is an exmple:
