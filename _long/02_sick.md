"Hon", I shouted to be louder than the laundry machine. <br>
"I did it", I continued with the same loudness. <br>
"Ok, go lie in the tub and keep your wrist under running water", she shouted back from our bedroom. <br>
"Just make sure you are not blocking the drain", she added.  <br>
"Warm water, or cold?" I enquired?<br>
"Warm", she replied.<br>
"I will come check on you in an hour or so", she assured me.<br>
"I love you", I said.<br>
"I love you too hon", she said.<br>
