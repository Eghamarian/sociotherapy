Her shoulder straps are out-stretched because she has pulled her dress down at the front to allow her perky breasts to hang out. She is casually playing chess with an online contender and is wearing a headset to answer her messages and to report on her game, which she has made available on the screen for all of us to see. Although she sucks at chess, the games she plays are the most interesting games I have watched so far; and I have watched Fischer, Kasparov, Karpov, Carlson, and some other pros in action. It is her character that makes her games interesting to watch. Every single time she makes an obvious mistake and gets hit by the opponent, she gasps for at least 5 seconds. After she is done gasping, she quickly recovers her endlessly positive attitude and continues with an ass-kicking mentality, until the next gasp of course, which is often a little longer and a little more intense. But no matter how many blunders she makes, she does not for a second loose her charm and her joy to be playing the game. And believe you me, with such mentality, she has been winning on many cases I have had the pleasure of being her audience. <br><br>

She is curvy and sweet as the honey we have been promised the rivers will taste in heaven. She likes sci-fi and comics, and has some of the grandest ideas about important topics such as whether we will be invaded by aliens, or whether aliens would appreciate having a Lush in their pussies. Make no mistake; she does address the feasibility of the aliens having a pussy before making her predictions. Don’t let her generosity in sharing her invaluable foresight give you the illusion that they are not meticulously thought through. Also, don’t let her charm and constantly shining smile make you think her sci-fi predictions are not gems, because they are. They are so precious that sometimes drones spy on her from her bedroom window to steal her ideas, which she does not mind, unless when she is masturbarting. Personally, I think sometimes drones that are watching her are off-duty, and are spending their day-off watching her because they have fallen in love with their gorgeous target like the rest of us. But that's just my theory. All this is just a warning for those who are not familiar with her; but if you are, I am sure you already know all this. In fact, I think her followers come to her room partly because they want to be a part of the sweet world she depicts in her live streams, and partly to worship her every inch from afar. They come to visit her world, and to watch her giggle at her own creation as soon as she creates them. <br><br>

As she is in deep thinking mode to plan for her next blunder, she is distracted by a fan who tips her 100 tokens. Obviously, you can’t think straight when your pussy is throbbing with the vibrations of the Lush inside it, even for a multi-million-tasker like her. Even the pros would make blunder after blunder if they had a Lush up their bum. Upon receiving the tip, like a kitten whose belly is rubbed, she leaves the chess board and the opponent to open her legs, and to reveal her pink pussy and the part of her Lush that is sticking out and is now lighting up with joy. She then rubs her clit a little to give the fan his money’s worth, moans a few times, rolls her eyes up as a sign of going unconscious with joy, sticks her tongue out as an invitation to a virtual BJ, thanks the fan and goes back to the opponent who is probably still waiting for her to make a decision on her next move. She gets back to the chess board, makes the blunder as planned, and gasps for 15 seconds. And it is the cutest thing I have seen in my life. <br><br>

I have no tokens in my account, because I am unemployed due to COVID and am extremely lonely; so I know if I spend any money on buying tokens, I will open the path for further purchases and will suffer the financial consequences. And without tokens I often refrain from making comments for two main reasons. Firstly, it is embarrassing because she can see how much I have been tipping her before, which in my case is zero. And secondly because it is not fair on her busy schedule. She is playing chess, accommodating a vibrating Lush in her pussy, reading people’s messages and coming up with genius predictions about aliens’ possible invasion very soon. But I am dying to tell her that I want to lay a kiss in the middle of her open mouth and to tell her she is amazing regardless of making all the blunders. But I think she already knows that. <br><br>
  
For me, the hardest temptation to resist is when there are many penniless folks like me in the room, and she entertains all of us with her games and stories, but has to leave without much in her account. Needless to say that she always leaves with a smile on her face, even though she knows the smile is directed at free-riders like me. When this happens, I find it extremely hard to resist buying tokens, because I hate to see her leave like that. So far, I have managed, but I don’t think I can resist much longer. In fact, I am sure I will not resist longer, because I am writing this note to accompany the tip I am sending her next time she comes on. <br><br>
