Me: There are a few new developments in my life and I wanted to discuss them with you. If you recall, when I was in Utrecht, one of my prof. sent me an opening in 
UBC (Vancouver). I applied at the time and got an interview, but I did not like biomedical statistics, and was not sure about coming to Canada then. 
So, I did not pursue it. Over the past few weeks, I have been applying to all available PhDs, even the ones I do not like. 
This is why it occurred to me last night to send the UBC people another email. I sent the email and this is the convenor's reply: 

Dear Sonil,
 
Thanks for reaching out and welcome to Canada! Unfortunately the grad recruitment season is over (deadline has passed) but we always can push for highly qualified candidates! 
Would you mind sending me your CV? And perhaps we can have a brief chat next week?

Me: Meanwhile, I received an email, followed by a phone call today from a trainee program run by the government. They have invited me to officially apply to the 
position because they have found me eligible. Their HR called and gave me some advice on changing my CV to have a higher chance of getting an interview

Him: Wow, nice.
Me: In the meantime, I have also been applying to PhDs in the Netherlands. I have applied to four so far, and the fifth application is ready.
Him: cool
Me: Now before I ask my question, I need to share some new pieces of information with you. 
Him: okay
Me: I know it is often impossible for people to separate their judgment from their wisdom, but what I would like to ask you to do, is to help me with your 
intelligence, not your knowledge of me. This is because we have been living apart for a very long time, and sometimes it is hard to see the difference 
between our preferences. But I am certain if we put our intelligence together, we can come up with a solution.
Him: sure
Me: For example, I have a strong fear of missing out. That means more options are debilitating for me. I want you to know this because I have heard you 
telling me time and again more options is always better. You may be right, but because I cannot see the advantage and disadvantages of them clearly, 
more options are often destructive for me. Regardless of knowing this, I am pursuing all three (and even more) channels, but I am already scared. I am scared
because I know 
because one more thing you probably need to be reminded of is how badly I manage my relationships.
Me: this means, I may not be able to act normally if I get into a program, and leave for another option without creating an awkward situation
Me: I know none of them have succeeded yet but I need you to start thinking in parallel
Him: i still don't know what your question is
Me: my question is how to plan
Him: plan what?
Me: right now, I would like to find a way of coming back to Europe
Him: well, Me jan, you come to europe if you find a good way
Me: but going to Vancouver (if I get admitted) means postponing it for three years
Him: it is also fine
Him: vancouver you can take mami with you
Him: its a great place
Me: especially while doing something I do not like, which can lead to burnout
Him: i can also think of us living there for a couple of years
Him: that's a different story
Him: but i can think of coming there
Him: for a year or so
Him: or two
Him: but again
Him: you don't have the option yet
Him: even if you get the position
Him: you can turn it down
Him: for 1001 reasons
Me: yes but I need to prioritize them in my head
Me: That is the point
Him: well only if you have them
Him: you will do
Me: for you it is easy
Him: you cannot prioritize options that you don't have
Me: for me the reasons do not come naturally
Him: it is not true
Him: then we discuss them
Him: few decisions were really hard in my life
Him: i made a decision
Him: to this day i am not sure if it was correct
Him: when i left academia
Him: in 2012
Him: took me six months
Him: i had three offers
Him: from french universities
Him: took me six months to make the decision
Him: at the end not sure
Him: so some deciisons are hard
Him: only those are hard if both options are good
Him: then it is a hard decision
Him: but for your current situation
Him: anything that improves your situation is good
Him: and you should more seriously consider your age
Him: and staying jobless for too long
Me: But imagine the trainee program admits me, and I get a PhD in NL
Him: moving to europe with no plan
Him: sure
Him: then I would go for what i like more
Him: considering everything
Him: you can also quit your trainee program
Me: How? Just tell them I have an offer, sorry I wasted your times but I want to go?
Him: if you choose to come to europe
Him: what?
Him: well, you have more reasons to come to NL
Him: closer to us
Him: possibility of mami stays with us at least six months a year
Him: these are great options
Me: They spend time, resources and probably money to hire, and train people
Him: but again it is your decision
Him: sure
Him: don't care about that one iota
Him: that should have -inf in your priority
Him: people make the best decision for their lives
Him: at every given moment
Him: it is part of their risk
Him: and organisations are not people
Him: they don't have feelings
Me: ok
Him: ignore that
Him: i have been on the hiring side of a few companies
Him: we put that part of our risks
Him: once i got a job for mohsen
Him: in my previous company
Him: he came and left in 20 days
Him: its a huge organisation
Him: nobody cares
Me: oh ok
Him: if need be
Him: they also fire you
Him: and they don't think about it
Him: you sent 1000s of resumes
Him: most didn't reply at all
Him: did they care?
Him: i would say for making such decision
Me: no, but I know I will be paralyzed if two of them happen together
Him: the best advice (which also applies to me btw)
Me: I will not know how to make the decision
Him: be the most important person of your own story
Him: if that happened
Him: we will chat more
Him: and you chose one of them
Him: and probably will never know which one was better
Him: if both are good enough
Me: ok then. I am going to follow all of them and then see what happens
Him: exactly
Him: good
Me: thank you  

Me: Do you accept I am autistic.
Him: Sure, I am no expert. But I would never think you were autistic. 
His mind: I am still not convinced you are autistic.
Me: So, you should also accept that I sometimes have difficulty seeing other people's point of view. I am not sure if this is relevant too, but I often fail
to see the intention behind my own actions. For example, I often fail to know why I am making a certain decision, until after I make the decision one way
or another. 
Him: Sure, that is easy to understand. 
His mind: I do not think that is the case. I think you often have your mind set on things. That is why you fail to see other people's view points. In fact, it is
for the same you do not see the intention behind your decisions. You want no obstacle on your way until the decision is made; and at the same time, you want to 
reserve the right to chenge your mind after you make a decision. It is more convenient this way; because you would need some justifications if you had known 
the reason behind your decision. 
Me: Another piece of information I would like you to know about me is this: "options" to me, are like sugar to a diabetic person.
