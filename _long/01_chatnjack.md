Lucy is lying on her back, with her bottom towards the camera. Her knees are bent, her legs are crossed, her left foot is dangling in the air, and except for a tiny ribbon covered by her white thong, her bottom-half goodies are entirely on display. She is wearing a white babydoll lingerie to match her white thong and white nail polish. She is checking her SnapChat above her face. I am wearing black boxer shorts, and am lying on my left side, facing the camera. But I am looking at my phone because I am reeling on instagram and can't stop. <br><br>
  
We have been streaming on Cummon Chat for an hour now, and we seem to have 273 viewers in our room, but nothing has been happening. I reckon most of the viewers are bots, and the rest are penniless folks, who are there to watch us having sex at other people's expense. But that's ok because we are not on the platform for money. But no one is talking to us and that is why we are not doing what we came here to do. Normally people who do not tip do not engage in coversation. I have no idea why but that may be because they feel obliged to contribute if you read their messages and respond to them. I may be wrong; all I know is that they don't engage in conversations as much as those who tip. And so far, no one has been talking to us, which is why we are not sure those watching are humans or bots. No one even answers our questions. So, we are just hanging around until someone says something or tips so we know someone is watching.<br><br>
  
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the platform, Cummon Chat is a platform, where performers stream sexual content, and viewers view and tip the performers. Like other social media platforms, Cummon Chat has other stuff for folks to interact too; things like following, liking, rating, reporting, emojis, and all the rest of it. It's a funny place, Cummon Chat. It is a smaller virtual sample of the real world. Performers come from all walks of life; some are real couples like Lucy and I, some are professional porn performers, some are current or ex-sex workers who have discovered the platform and are excited to earn a living from the comfort of their homes and some are perverts or simply looking for some excitement. All these people get on the platform and compete with each other to get more viewers. Their ideals is to have more loyal viewers and fans, because that means every time they come on, their fans logon to watch them, and tip them for their performance. But like in the real life, distribuion of chance is not equitable. It seems that prettier folks invariably have more followers. So, from the start, some people are much ahead of others in the game.  <br><br>
