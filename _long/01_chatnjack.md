Lucy is lying on her back, with her bottom towards the camera. Her knees are bent, her legs are crossed, her left foot is dangling in the air, and except for a tiny ribbon covered by her white thong, her bottom-half goodies are entirely on display. She is wearing a white babydoll lingerie to match her white thong and white nail polish. She is checking her SnapChat above her face. I am wearing black boxer shorts, and am lying on my left side with my right facing the camera. I am reeling on instagram and I can't stop. <br><br>
  
We have been streaming on Cummon Chat for an hour now and we seem to have 273 viewers in our room, but nothing has been happening. I reckon most of the viewers are bots, and the rest are penniless folks, who are here to watch us having sex at other people's expense. But that's ok because we are not on the platform for money. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the platform, Cummon Chat is a platform, where performers stream sexual content, and viewers view and tip the performers. Like other social media platforms, Cummon Chat has other stuff for folks to interact too; things like following, liking, rating, reporting, emojis, and all the rest of it.
