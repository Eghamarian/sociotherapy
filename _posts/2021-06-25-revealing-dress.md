For a long time I have been hearing women complain about men who feel welcome to comment on women's sexual appeal or flirt with them when they have sexy clothes on. Men who engage in such behaviour often justify their attitudes based on what the women were wearing at the time, interpreting the sexiness of the clothes as a green light for their flirting. But I have yet to see a woman who sees some merit in such an argument, and in this article I would like to try and explain why I think the argument is valid to some extent. 

To do this, I need to give a bit of history. When we lived in tribal communities, we wore nothing unless it was to keep us warm.  With clothes having a practical purpose, there was no sensible difference between men and women when it came to the message conveyed by our dressing style as we wore the same type of clothes. However, things started to change when Christian values started to condemn nudity and encouraged people to cover their bodies for reasons other than warmth or survival. That was the beginning of nudity being wrapped in a aura of mystery and becoming a taboo. The thing about taboos is that it is exciting to imagine, or actually breaking them. This is in fact what happened. 
  
In some underground circles, groups of people started producing pornography and distributing them among those who were interested. In the beginning however, such content were exclusively circulated among the elite, who were determined to protect the masses from their corrupting potential. But suppression of a desire always leads to its eruption, which is precisely what happened. Bewildered by the mystry it carried, more and more people started to seek such content to the extent that they were heavily saught after. Note must be made that throughout this period, the content producers in the underground industry was male-dominated, so the majority of the content being produced were focused on female bodies as subject of their content. 
  
This continued until revolutionaries in France started using sexual content to promote their propaganda. To the best of my knowledge this was the first time porn was used as a tool to increase the penetrability of messages in societies. But this was one of the determining stages in objectification of women. The second decisive impact came from the refinements carried by the content producers to increase the appeal of their content. Following the use of porn as a propaganda facilitator in France, pornographic content started circulating in hands of the masses. With demand rising in the society, suppliers started thinking about ways to improve their content, which is when they first thought of sexification of pornographic subjects, which were mainly females at the time. This marked a point in history were clothes carried messages and created reactions among the consumers. Because at the time there were little foundation to conduct consumer preference analysis, content producers resorted to trial and error and refined their contents based on the feedback they would get from the market. For example, they would get their femal subject to wear a mesh gown and see the reaction of the makret, which in this particular case was immensley positive.
