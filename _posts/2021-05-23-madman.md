  United States is like a drunken thug in fancy clothes, sipping fancy wine, and going around smashing windows and causing crisis after crisis.
  Then it extorts its way out of crisese by attacking other states based on a lie. <!--more-->
  Many European countries on the other hand, are like gentle people who try to be as equitable as possible when it comes to their own people. 
  But that means every penny in their systems has a name on it. This is probably why in Europe, we do not see a guy wearing fluorescent green Louis Vuitton head-to-toe, leaning against his fluorescent green lamborghini.<br><br>

    <em>Wealth in its most repulsive shape</em>
</p>

  Such extravagance inevitably means someone in the US is wearing very little throughout the year. 
  And this is why Europe is always more vulnerable against the US. 
  By virtue of being a capitalist state, the US has access to more capital, and thereby more dispensible wealth. 
  This is because it simply accumulates more capital, and when it looses it in a crisis, it steals from others in broad daylight. This is what Trump said in an interview with FOX News: <br><br>
  
  "I left troops [in Iraq] to take the oil; I took the oil; the only troops I have, are taking the oil; they're protecting the oil; I took over the oil". <br><br>
  
  The consequence of this is that the sober side of the US gets to invest zilliions in research and development, so it can invent things that generate more wealth; and the hoodlum side of the US engages in speculations and hedging against the risk of the risk of the risk of a dreaming American who aspires to have a house. Once again all of this is possible because the scantily-clad person is not a prioroty. <br><br>
  This is also why the US can take advantage of the Madman Strategy in international stage. 
  In the aftermath of his success, and in one of his standup shows, Ricky Gervais once said "I could have this place [the venue] burnt down for a laugh", to convey how rich he has become. 
  This is precisely what the US can do. It can just have places burnt down for a laugh, because that has very little impact on the lives of its filthy rich and filthy poor, even if the plan backfires. But the same thing in Europe will have a dislocating consequence; it will shift people downwardly on the social hierarchy and significantly disrpts its welfare system.
