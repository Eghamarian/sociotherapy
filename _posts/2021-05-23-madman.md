Capitalist states are like drunken thugs in fancy clothes, sipping fancy wine, going around smashing windows and causing crisis after crisis.
After each crisis, they extort their way out by attacking other states based on a lie. <!--more-->
Welfare states on the other hand, are like gentle people who try to be as equitable as possible when it comes to their own people. 
But that means every penny in their systems has a name on it. This is probably why in welfare states, we do not see a guy wearing fluorescent green Louis Vuitton head-to-toe, leaning against his fluorescent green Lamborghini.<br><br>

Such extravagance inevitably means someone in the capitalist state is wearing very little throughout the year. 
And this is why welfare states are always more vulnerable against the capitalist ones. 
By virtue of being capitalist states, they have access to more capital, and thereby more dispensible wealth. 
This is because they simply accumulate more capital, and steal from others when they loose it in a crisis. As an exmaple, this is what Trump said in an interview with FOX News: <br><br>
  
<em>"I left troops [in Iraq] to take the oil; I took the oil; the only troops I have, are taking the oil; they're protecting the oil; I took over the oil".</em> <br><br>
  
The consequence of this is that the sober side of the capitalist state gets to invest zillions in research and development, so it can invent things that generate more wealth; while its hoodlum side engages in speculations and hedging against the risk of a hedged risk of a hedged risk of a dreaming middle class, guilty of aspiring to have a house. Once again all of this is possible because the scantily-clad person is not a prioroty. <br><br>
This is also why the capitalist state can take advantage of the Madman Strategy in international stage. 
In the aftermath of his success, and in one of his standup shows, Ricky Gervais once said, <em>"I could have this place [the venue] burnt down for a laugh"</em>, to convey how rich he has become. 
This is precisely what capitalist states can do; they can just have places burnt down for a laugh, because that has very little impact on the lives of their filthy rich and filthy poor, even if the plan backfires. But the same thing in welfare states will have a dislocating consequence; it will shift people downwardly on the social hierarchy, and significantly disrpts their welfare systems. So, they can't even produce a believable bluff in game-theoretic settings.
