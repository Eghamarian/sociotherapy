Imagine you teach a class. The class consists mainly of normal kids except for two bullies, who are obsessed with their desires, and are a little manipulative, aggressive, and dominating. The two also have a sense of entitlement, and a strong sense of conviction. You also have an autistic student who normally keeps to himself and is obsessed with computers.<!--more--> Now suppose students get a pizza day once every week, but you have your suspicions that some students remain hungry after the pizzas are over. This is why you decide to observe the students from the outside to see what happens. For argument’s sake, let us assume all students in the class like pizza, but the two bullies are obsessed with it. When you leave the room, the bullies grab two full pizzas of a popular type. While they start devouring a couple of slices from the popular pizzas, they start to go around and negotiate with people that they would exchange one slice of their pizza for two slices of theirs. They continue trading like this until the content of their boxes are empty. Although at this point they realize, that even according to their set standards, they have reached the end of their meal, they do not follow their own rules of the game, because they still want more. So they change their own rule. They then just brazenly grab a couple of slices from the boxes of others without standing around for a probable discussion; they take and walk away. The aspie also likes pizza a lot, but he likes computers more. So, he is content with what he gets as long as he gets to play with his laptop.

<br><br>
 
Following your observations, you promise yourself to keep the desires, bullying, and cheating capacities of the two bullies in check. From then on, you make sure every student gets the same number of slices and of the same variety as everyone else. This is the point when the bullies shift entirely to their manipulation capacity, because you would penalize them if you found out they took other people’s share by force. Force never seizes to be a manipulation tool though. It just changes format. For example, they use force and threaten students outside the class and coerce them to give them their share voluntarily. The two bullies work in coordination and force students to agree to share their pizza in class and threaten them that they would give them a real lesson if they tell on them. Obviously, they also make use of other manipulative tool such as promises, or use various kinds of coercions. The coalition of the two bullies is at its weakest when the rest of the students form a union and work as a group. Only then, the two bullies resort to compromise, and see no option but to postpone their desires. However, every minute, of every day, of every month, of every year, they look for opportunities to weaken the solidarity between the students. 

<br><br>
  
Now fast forward to 30 years later. All student have found their passions and have pursued their interest in the form of a hobby or a career. The aspie already had an obsession with computers, so he launched a software company that makes operating systems for computers. He is a billionaire now. The bullies have also found their obsessions. One became obsessed with power, as he was then, and the other with money. One became a politician and the other a businessman. The two still work together in most cases. They still work as a team to secure more and more of what they desire, using the same old techniques. However, there are two main differences; one positive and one negative. The positive is that the teacher is no longer watching over them. In fact, the politician sits in the position of the teacher with the responsibility of implementing justice. The negative aspect is that, even in the absence of an outside supervisor, it is not easy to blatantly take what they desire; they need to manufacture popular consent. To do this, a set of agreements is necessary. The good news is that, unlike the days where the teacher was supervising them, there is no need to give back all of the pizzas taken, even if they are caught. If and when the business man takes more than his share, what he needs to do, is to give “part” of the “extra” back. There are also many caveats here. The business man gets a relief if he exchanges his pizzas for other products. He also gets a cut if he invest his pizza in new adventures, such as expanding his markets to the moon, although he is the only person on earth who thinks that is necessary. If there is still some surplus after he runs out of ideas, the politician prepares the foundation for the businessman to register his pizzas through a shell company that is registered in a region with zero corporate tax. This is only possible if the politician succeeds in convincing the public that those who earn more, pay more tax; and only then the businessman will be legitimized to continue pursuing his obsession with no real obstacle. But this is all right up the politician's alley; he has a lot of practice switching between force and manipulation to get what he has wanted. What's in it for him, you ask? Although the real obsession of the politician is power, he also gets to satisfy his passion for money through his business-minded friend, who funds his campaigns and sends him gifts of various kinds.

You may think there is nothing wrong with people pursuing their passion and making money along the way. Well, that is not quite true. First of all, it is essential to distinguish between “passion” and “obsession”. When you are passionate about something, you pursue it; you pursue it automatically and with a healthy attitude; but you survive if your pursuit is interrupted. You also naturally stop, if your passion clashes with other people’s welfare or wellbeing. But obsession is not like that. That who is obsessed, cannot stop under any circumstances. For example, they know their relationship is at stake, but they stay in office and work; they know their family needs attention, but they continue to provide them with money instead; they know their employees are suffering under pressure, but they continue to press for more profit. The reason we do not see this as a problem, is to do with a plague we all have been infected with, a plague which convinces us “no pain, no gain”. We have been led to believe nothing big comes out of feeling cosy; that to achieve big things we need big sacrifices. The attitude has become a virtue to propel human discoveries, knowledge and wealth. The question is where did this idea come from? Was it always with us? Is it even true?

<br><br>  

The idea was first advocated by liberalist thinkers, who believed humans must be free to realize their full potential, and for this to happen, they should be protected from external interference, coercion, suppression, etc. This is all good, so long as the state has some level of supervision on the behaviour of agents. This means that individuals are free to realize their potential, but they need to share their earnings with others in the society. To propagate growth and development throughout the society,it is also essential for the state to also have some influence over prioritizing investments and controling and directing wealth in ways that is most beneficial to the entire community. However, all this changed with the advent of Neo-liberalism, which strongly advocated near complete absence of state from the market. This essentially meant that markets would have carte blanche to determine where to invest, how to invest and how to distribute the generated wealth. This was also accompanied with lower tax and inflation rates, both of which were supposed to encourage more investment. So, unlike liberalism, which allowed individuals to reach their full potential as long as they propelled the entire community forward, the Neo-liberalism allows them to be entitled to the outcome with little to no liability to the community. In fact, markets started to gain transnational sovereignty, because with the advancements in technology and banking, capital started to migrate to cyber space, and became completely fluidized. So, in search of more profit and competitive advantage, agents in the market started to look for opportunities all across the world. They transferred their capital to places with more gain and created employment in countries with much lower labour costs and much worse working conditions; they then transferred their profits to a remote country where corporate tax is non-existant. This is why the have become impossible to hold liable to the local state for their taxes, investment decisions etc. 

<br><br> 
  
It is one thing to know where the the focus on individal potential, individual gain and naturalness of competition came from; and another to know why they have become so ingrained in our belief systems. The answer is in our story of the bullies. Establishment after establishment in advanced countries, especially in the US, have been advocating, promoting and investing on the ideology. Just as in our little classroom, politicians’ campaigns have been heavily funded by businesses, who in turn have been enjoying access to promotion of certain legislations and structural changes. The most convenient coincidence has also been the clash between capitalism and communism, which has been giving US politicians an excuse to implement demands of business in the name of anti-communist mottos. This is the main reason most of us do not dare question the underlying assumptions of competitions, market economies, individual potential and gains. Because as soon as we question any of these concepts, we can be accused of being a lazy bum Communist who want to be paid out of the sweat of those with ambitions, aspirations, and motivation. This is why we thought the first half of our story, where the teacher supervises students' access to pizza, made perfect sense; but questioned the second half, when the students were grown adults pursuing their goals. This is why in the context of a classroom, it is acceptable for a teacher to implement equity, but in society, individual differences must not be curtailed, because that is in contrast to liberalist ideas on which our whole civilization have grown to rest. But note; all these ideas have been promulgated by the bullies who have succeeded to get their hands on the object of their obsession, or those who are making progress to that end. They do not want to loose their positions, or the promise of having such positions. This is why they justify their parasitic behaviour by resorting to concepts such as “competition being natural” or “liberalism”. The idea that competition is natural is quite insulting too. Competition actually is anything but natural. No species of animals entirely rely on competition. The alphas among them may have a fight to establish their reign. However, after that row is settled, the entire community work in harmony to promote welfare in the community, and to protect every member of that community.  What makes the idea of competition being natural dangerous, is that the resources are finite in the world. In other words, there are only a limited number of pizzas. If we do not control the uncontrollable craving of some people, there will inevitably be less or none available to others. It is noteworthy that one of the main tennets of both liberalist and neo-liberalist ideologies, is the aspiration to create a level-playing field for everyone to be able to realize their potential. But for reasons mentioned earlier, this tennet is under serious threat now. In fact, the same ideologies are working to actively crush the very values they were born to protect. 

<br><br>
 
You may ask, how about innovations? Surely, the ground is more furtile for new ideas to take root and blosom into full-fledged businesses, which in turn create growth for the entire community. But if we look at the creation of ideas, they are mainly generated where capital has already been accumulated. In other words, those who have access to capital, have a significant upper hand in generating ideas and wealth. It is extremely difficult to compete with R&D of big corporations, and come up with a new idea. This is much more the case now, because there is no restrictions on corporations, who invest in different areas of research ranging from artificial meat to driverless car production. The problem is that these companies are often the same companies who have a shell company off-shore, and refrain from contributing to the growth of the community. The ambience is also such that newcomers catch the same disease, and register a shell company off-shore as soon as they become meaningfully profitable, so they can remain comppetitive. Competitive advnatge is key here. In a world that allows cheating to be directly translated into wealth, not cheating directly translate into loosing the competition. This is why the promise of neo-liberalism, that a bigger pizza means bigger slices for eveyone, is a false one. Maybe this is true for a very limited period of time, but certainly not for very long. First of all, the assumption that the tax system is just and supervised is wrong. So the generated wealth will be disproportionately distributed among a few. How about creating employment? As soon as a company innovates in a highly competitive world, other companies will follow in their foot steps. In no time, the innovation finds competition; maybe not using exactly the same technology due to property rights, but the outcome is often very similar. Look at smart phone companies. Soon after one comes up with a technology, they all follow suit with minor tweaks in working of the technology, but with very similar results. This process continues until there will be enough rivals in the market and the competition will come down to traditional concepts such as cost, price and services. And that is the point where capital migrates to remote locations in the world where tax does not exist, where labour is cheap, and where unions are not formed so they can juice employees for higher efficiency. This is why I call such people obsessed rather than passionate. You have to be extremely insensitive to continue pursuing your goal, knowing the other side to a kid buoyant with happiness for having your product, is a kid working long hours every day to survive. 

<br><br>
  
  
The last objection you may have, is that the access of big corporations to capital, and hence their potential for research and development, can and will have spill-over effect when they find a solution to a social problem. This is yet another myth, promulgated by the cooperation between politicians and corporations. First of all, it is profit-making potential of problems that determines allocation of resources, and in most cases, the resources allocated to absolutely unnecessary solutions, such as making a thinner phone, by far outweigh the amount spent on solving human problems. In fact, in the absence of all corporations producing smarter phones and smaller cameras, which are in major part used to undo most of feministic efforts to date, human societies can perfectly continue their peaceful existence. All that said, it is true that some innovations are helping humans, like medications and medical research. But they are so comparatively small that they can be taken up with local governments, or be funded by a small portion of tax payers’ revenue. In fact this is currently happening in many cases, including the solutions that major corporations companies claim to own. For example, invention of the Internet was mainly by DARPA, which was an agency inside the Department of Defense, invention of GPS came out of funcing by the American Navy, invention of touchscreen display came from the funding by the CIA, etc. So, although these facts are absent in ipublic debate, most of what corporations claim they have invented, and are surely profiting from, have been publicly financed. So, in most cases they do not even spend a part of their revenue on research. Useful research is often done by states, or through government funded projects. This is why all the money in corporations' systems are used for creating products, creating demand and giving bonuses to their managers.

To go back to the topic of this article and talk about “How to be successful”, which seems to be a money maker for many influencers, I would argue that success has nothing to do with talent or hard work. If you want to be successful, you need to have a passion. If you have one, you will know it. There is no need to search and discover it. If you do not see it, chances are you do not have a passion. It is possible and it is absolutely normal. Remember, although a passion can make you happy and successful, it cannot make you exceptionally successful or a game changer. If you want to be a game changer, you need to have an obsession. If you have one, again you will know it and you will not be reading this, because unless your obsession is to read random articles from unknown people, chances are very high that you do not have time for anything but your obsession. This is the only way you can be exceptional, because with obsession, you will be remain focused on your goal while those with passion and those with neither take a break or spend time on other things, which is how you will get ahead of the game step by step. But remember, if you are obsessed, you will not know when you have reached your destination. 

<br><br>
  
Although an obsession can make you a game changer or exceptionally successful, it will not make you rich or powerful. If you want to be powerful, your obsession must revolve around leadership and control. If you want to be rich, your obsession must be readily monetaizable. No degree of obsession with Physics can make you rich. Sure, you can win a Nobel prize and a million dollar; but an Uber driver can make that in a few years too. So, if you are lucky, your obsession is monetizable and you will get rich if that is what you want. Remember, if you are obsessed with money, you will automatically be pursuing monetizable activities. So once again, you need not concern yourself with your choice. Same is true about obsession with power. 

<br><br>
  
Finally, to be exceptionally successful you will need certain personality traits. Like our two bullies, you will need to be insensitive, manipulative, arrogant (they themselves call it confidence), conviction, and the most important of all, entitlement. Without these, you will inevitable face innumerable conundrums because without these chances are you will be able to criticize yourself, which is when your inhibitions will kick in. However, with these qualities, you will not criticize yourself, or will successfully ignore the evidence and you will be able to continue with your journey towards your obsession. 

Based on my observation, there is little you can do to be successful because no degree of disciple can prepare you to compete with the obsessed. So, if you used to snatch food from the hands of other children and ate it without remorse, chances are you will be exceptionally successful. If you did not, chances are you will not be exceptionally successful. That said, many reputable educational institutions across the world know about this. In fact, the main agenda in many of these schools is to generate obsessive attitude among students by constantly pushing them to push themselves to the limit and staying there for prolonged periods of time.
