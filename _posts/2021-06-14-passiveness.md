We can hardly look after ourselves, let alone our loved ones. <br>
But we are surrounded by digital advertising machines showcasing a few success stories. <br>
It makes one drool imagining what it's like to be them.  <br>
Thankfully, their secret is easy to find, because sharing it has been a recent trend, and they do anything for a few more likes. <br>  
The key ingredient is <em> passive </em>; passive income, passive attention, passive weight loss, passive everything. <br>
Loose weight while eating; learn a language while sleeping, earn a decent salary while sunbathing. <br>
You may think I want to complain that people now desire to take waiting out of wanting. <br>
But that is not my intention.   <br>
My concern is that passiveness has contaminated more important parts of our lives. <br>
We now have <b> passive activism </b>, which is when we do our share of activism by clicking on a link, 
liking a video or leaving a post, before closing our laptop and going to bed.<br>
We hope while we sleep, our post frees Julian Assange, our like saves the Earth, and our shared link illuminates the uneducated.<br>
But while we sleep, nothing happens. <br>
Nothing happens except our links and likes and posts enter the magnetic field of social media, and become polarized and shot into distant poles; 
where they are liked or hated by other passive activists. <br>
Even then, the number of likes never beat the cute cat, the sexy 18-year-old big bang, and the dance videos. <br> 
So, basically, our links and likes and posts are thrown into a blackhole while we sleep, just like a dream; <br>
as if they were never real, and will never be.<br>
And the politicians are ecstatic about this.<br>
Once in a while, they summon the giants and put on a show of telling them off.<br>
Answer me with a "yes" or a "No". 
"Yes, senator", 
"Can you provide so and so information to this committee?".
"Senator, that is something that I will follow up with you, or your team after the hearing".
Every time, they send them back to their duty of diffusing people's tendency to be active and unified. <br>
with more of "Cuz I gotta a small waist, pretty face with a big bang".
