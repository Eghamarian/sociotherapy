We can hardly look after ourselves, let alone our loved ones. But we are surrounded by digital advertising machines showcasing a few success stories. It makes one drool imagining what it's like to be them. <!--more-->Thankfully, their secret is easy to find, because sharing it has been a recent trend, and they do anything for a few more likes. <br><br>
    
The key ingredient is <em> passive </em>; passive income, passive attention, passive weight loss, passive everything. Loose weight while eating; learn a language while sleeping, earn a decent salary while sunbathing. You may think I want to complain that people now desire to take waiting out of wanting. But that is not my intention. My concern is that passiveness has contaminated more important parts of our lives. We now have <b> passive activism </b>, which is when we do our share of activism by clicking on a link, liking a video or leaving a post, before closing our laptop and going to bed.<br><br>

We hope while we sleep, our post frees Julian Assange, our like saves the Earth, and our shared link illuminates the uneducated. But while we sleep, nothing happens. Nothing happens except our links and likes and posts enter the magnetic field of social media, and become polarized and shot into distant poles; where they are liked or hated by other passive activists. Even then, the number of likes never beat the cute cat, the sexy 18-year-old big bang, and the dance videos. So, basically, our links and likes and posts are thrown into a blackhole while we sleep, just like a dream; as if they were never real, and will never be.<br><br>

And the politicians are ecstatic about this. Once in a while, they summon the giants, and put on a show of telling them off, which normally goes like this:<br><br>

Senator: Answer me with a "yes" or a "No". <br>
Giant's Boss: Yes, senator. <br>
Senator: Can you provide so and so information to this committee?. <br>
Giant's Boss: Senator, that is something that I will follow up with you, or your team after the hearing.<br><br>
 
The question is, do they ever? Shouldn't the senators ask the giants to come back in a week with the requested information? Do they? I guess we never know, because the <b> corporate </b> media is run on a profit-generating model, and hence covers newsworthy and trending news only. They are the judges of what is newsworthy too. As far as I can see, they think the hearing is newsworthy, but the follow-up, not so much. <br><br>
    
Again, from where I stand, it appears that every time, the giants are sent back to their duty of diffusing people's tendency to be active and unified, with more of "Cuz I gotta a small waist, pretty face with a big bang".<br>
