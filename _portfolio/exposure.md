Over the course of history, we have been attempting to define our collective selves in terms of what we eat, think, do, see or believe in. Many of these proclamations have been put forwards by thinkers, who necessitated by their environments, attempted to find collective behaviour in societies, which they could treat as the defining characteristic of individuals, and society as the sum of those individuals. Following in the foot steps of more contemporary thinkers, my attempt here is to use theories of sociologists to argue that, for the past few decades, the defining characteristic of individuals and societies are no longer determined by individuals' behaviour, but by how the forces that encourage them to behave in certain ways. Specifically, with the uptake of neo-liberalism as the main doctrine by which to govern societies, and with the ever-increasing dis-embeddedness of the markets from societies, markets, as exogenous forces to both societies and therefore individuals, have become determinants of who we are as individuals and as societies.
