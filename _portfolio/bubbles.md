When under water, your screams transform into trapped air
When under water for long, you will learn no longer to bother. 
When under water all your life, you
become translucent,
like water;
You become a dreamer of voices and air, and you scream in all your nightmares 

And when you are repeatedly hurt by those who canâ€™t hear you, you think of dissolving forever. 
For in their ears, your absence is louder than tears
Because when you are invisible, the only way to prove you exist, is to hurt yourself, not your lovers
